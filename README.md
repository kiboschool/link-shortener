# Link shortener

A link shortener like [bitly](https://bitly.com/), [tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com/), or [short.io](https://short.io/).

Built using lots of different web frameworks, to demonstrate similarities and
differences between them.

Different versions use the same html, css, and logic every time, so all versions 
should be roughly the same.

## Features

* Create a new short url from a given link
* When navigating to the short url, the app will redirect to the original link
* View all the short urls that have been created
* Edit or delete a short url

non-features (things the app does not have):
- users or logins
- click tracking
- custom domains

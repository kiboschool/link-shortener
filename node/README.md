# Link Shortener - Node (http module, without express)

A version of the link shortener app using Node, without a framework.

Currently 'persists' urls to an in-memory array, not to a database.

Still uses dependencies:
- ejs for rendering templates
- node-static for serving static files

## Get Started

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Start the dev server

```sh
node server.js
```
